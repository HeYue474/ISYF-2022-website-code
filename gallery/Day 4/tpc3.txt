For the past three days, the delegates came together and poured their wisdom into the ten innovative models they built to tackle the ten imminent challenges facing Astrum. Through the TPC Showcase, they demonstrated to the citizens of Astrum how their collaborative effort can save the island nation from the looming climate crisis. We are sure that all delegates have learnt a lot through this unique experience and the inhabitants of Astrum will now live in peace and harmony with nature.
