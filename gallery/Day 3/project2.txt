[Student Project Exhibition]
<br/>The Student Project Exhibition is, perhaps unsurprisingly, a session where delegates get to showcase their own carefully curated posters and research expertise, as well as view other delegatesâ€™ posters. More than that, however, are the lively discussions and voting that followed each poster presentation. We hope that all delegates have enjoyed this mini and digitalised project exhibition session. ðŸ˜Š
